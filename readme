Problem 2.8.1 JollyJumpers

A sequence of N > 0 integers is called a jolly jumper if the absolute values of the differences between successive elements take on all possible values 1 through n-1. For instance,

 1 4 2 3

 is a jolly jumper, because the absolute differences are 3, 2,  and 1, respectively. The definition implies that any sequence of a single integer is a jolly jumper.  Write a program to determine whether each of a number of sequences is a jolly jumper.

 Input

 Each line of input contains an integer n < 3,000 followed by n integers representing the sequence.

 Output

 For each line of input generate a line of output saying "Jolly" or "Not Jolly"

 Sample Input

 4 1 4 2 3
 5 1 4 2 -1 6

 Sample output

 Jolly
 Not Jolly
